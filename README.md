TrueCryptCrack
==============

Simple tool to recover lost password for TrueCrypt using dictionary.

It is not designed to be error proof, sorry.
But it works! I was able to recover ~50 chars password!

You may get a false positive if device you want to recover is already mounted.

Password list must be defined in separate file ([example](https://github.com/keradus/TrueCryptCrack/blob/master/TrueCryptCrack/bin/Release/sample_passwords.txt)), which may be generated by tool like [maskprocessor](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=maskprocessor).

Tool is driven by config JSON file ([example](TrueCryptCrack/bin/Release/sample_config.json)).

You may create a dictionary map to remap single char into whole word. Then the maskprocessor may be used to generate list of combined words by generating only ids of them instead of full words saving time and space. [Example password list](https://github.com/keradus/TrueCryptCrack/blob/master/TrueCryptCrack/bin/Release/sample_passwords.txt) remaped by [example dictionary map](https://github.com/keradus/TrueCryptCrack/blob/master/TrueCryptCrack/bin/Release/sample_config.json) produce [example resolved password list](https://github.com/keradus/TrueCryptCrack/blob/master/TrueCryptCrack/bin/Release/sample_passwords_full.txt).

When running a tool you need to provide config file as argument:
```console
TrueCryptCrack.exe config.json
```
